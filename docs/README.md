# Overview

mjolnir.js is a JavaScript event and gesture handling module. It is built on top of and named [in homage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mj%C3%B6lnir) of the classic [hammer.js](http://hammerjs.github.io/) library.


## Features

On top of the pointer gestures that Hammer.js offers, mjolnir.js adds support for the following events:
* Right mouse button Gestures
* Generic mouse events such as pointermove and pointerleave without requiring button down
* Mouse wheel events
* Keyboard events
* Event propagation without firing [DOM events](http://hammerjs.github.io/api/#domevents-false).


## Platforms supported

The primary focus is to support so called evergreen browsers as well as mobile browsers, but PRs for older browser will generally be accepted.
